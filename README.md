# Project_ML_2018-2019
Project for machine learning course

This code is written in R, so it's necessary to install the r interpreter. I installed the version in this link
http://cran.mirror.garr.it/mirrors/CRAN/.
It's necessary to install these packages from the menu bar:
rpart
mlbench
rpart.plot
phonTools
I installed these packages from italian (Padua) mirror CRAN.
